# lua-challanges
Some LUA challanges that I did that took longer than it should have.

# Factoiral Function
A simple function that finds the Factoiral of the mentioned number.

# IsDivisable Function
Another simple function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y.

# 100 Doors Challange
The longest out of all these, check out the challange for yourself here: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/100_doors.
